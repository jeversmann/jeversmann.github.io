We live in the future, and the future is no place for forums.

There is great value to be gained from having conversations on the internet in a mostly static and exeternally observable way.
The internet is better for having archives of banter, speculation, advice, and stories.
Internet forums however, despite being very common, are good for none of these things.
Websites that use forums as their model of discussion inherit a number of problems that tend to come with the territory.

0. Following conversations is hard.
0. Information density is low.
0. Finding quality posts is hard.

These problems have been solved, and we should dump forums in favor of something that has learned from their mistakes.

### Conversation Threads

At their core, Formus are all linearly ordered collections of posts.
This is some people's ideal model of a conversation, but falls short in practice.
People talking about something inevitability degrades into people talking to each other,
and when all posts are in a single time ordered list it is left to the reader to keep the conversation threads separate.
This structure also necessitates direct quoting of posts as part of a response to the post,
which is common in most forum communities but only increases the burden on the reader to follow conversations.

Sorting responses into threads is a common UI pattern.
Many people are used to this with their email, as email by design suffered from this same problem when all messages were displayed in the order they were received despite being from separate conversations.
Many, many sites now display responses to posts indented under the original post,
sometimes with color coding or thread collapsing or other UI niceties built on top.

### Information Density

Forum designers/owners/maintainers all make their own separate decisions about what comes with each post:
avatars, signatures, achievements, action buttons, and various different types of account information are all available and each forum picks their own set to display.
It isn't fair to say that none of these things have their place, but it is worth paying attention to how much of an average screen contains actual content.
If people aren't writing long posts, as little as 5% of the screen space ends up being given to actual text;
the problem gets less significant as posts get longer, but is further exacerbated by the repetitive quoting mentioned above.

This isn't a problem inherent to forums, but other methods of communication have learned this lesson.
Commenting systems on social networks or news sites incorporate some of these same elements per post,
but significantly slimmed them down to make more space for content.
Nothing needs to be replaced for this problem to be fixed; people just need to start paying attention.

### Post Quality

The usefulness of forums as an archive of information is degraded when there is no method to increase the visibility of worthwhile posts.
In a forum thread where the topics are often questions, the conversations are rarely useful to answering the question.
It isn't uncommon to end up on a forum after Googling a problem and have to sort through pages of arguing and discussion for yourself instead of there being a digested answer to the question available.
Even forums centered more around discussion than answers suffer from low quailty posts being stuck in prominent locations because incorrect or inflamatory posts can often derail conversations.

Stack Exchange is the prime example of this system done right.
Their system was designed to collect questions/topics and push the best responses to the top,
making sites like Stack Overflow the primary source for their types of information.
There are too many communities that run their advice/discussions through forums and lose out on ease of access to their informaiton.
