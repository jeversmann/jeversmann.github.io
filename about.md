This site is served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using assets from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
There are a number of other sites I work on, such as [screamwith.me](http://screamwith.me/), [UTCS-Uptime](https://nosotrosnueces.github.io/utcs-uptime/) and whatever is on [statictypes.me](http://statictypes.me/);

### Twitter

On Twitter I'm [@TheJEversmann](https://twitter.com/TheJEversmann),
because my usual handle was taken and I don't matter enough to take it back.

### GitHub

On GitHub I'm obvously [jeversmann](https://github.com/jeversmann), feel free to check out my profile.
